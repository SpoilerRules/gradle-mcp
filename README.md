# gradle-mcp | MCP 1.8.9
This repository is designed to help Minecraft client developers and source code researchers in simplifying their development process through the use of Gradle, a modern build tool. In contrast to traditional MCP 1.8.9, this setup allows easy management of dependencies, project configuration, and more. Built upon the foundation of [MavenMCP](https://github.com/Marcelektro/MavenMCP-1.8.9/tree/master).

### Why did I create this?
I was motivated developing my own client using the unmodified MCP. However, I was not a fan of the traditional MCP that includes a "Start.java" file and requires you to manage dependencies yourself. Additionally, it offers limited project customization. After some research, I discovered MavenMCP, which nearly met my needs. However, as Maven ages, it no longer fits my modern requirements. Hence, I decided to create my own solution.

### Interested in a modern solution?
